        <h2>To make classic spaghetti aglio e olio, simply…</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the spaghetti. Cook the spaghetti in a generously-salted pot of boiling water until it is just one
                minute shy of being al dente.
                Sauté the garlic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large
                sauté pan over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5
                minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden.
                Toss the pasta in the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta immediately to the sauté pan, along with
                1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water. Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the
                garlic sauce. If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.
                Taste and season.
            </li>
            <li>
                Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.
                Serve.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.
            </li>
        </ol>
